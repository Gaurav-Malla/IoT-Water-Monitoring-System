# IoT-Water-Monitoring-System
An IoT-based system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to monitor water levels in a tank. Built using Arduino and integrated with an IoT cloud platform for real-time monitoring and alert generation based on threshold values.
## Features
- Real-time water level monitoring using an ultrasonic sensor
- Data transmission to the IoT platform for remote access
- Visual dashboard with live status updates
- Alert notifications based on defined thresholds
- Low-cost, power-efficient design suitable for household or agricultural use

## Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- IoT Platform (ThingSpeak or Blynk)
- Embedded C / Arduino IDE
- Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266 if used)

## Future Improvements
- Add water pump automation
- Use mobile app for notifications
- Integrate with home automation system
